##EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

You got data, need to find patterns, insights not sure about end output
information you get out of it may be useful or may not be for clients

######Data sourcing
1. Loading Data into system

######Data cleaning
1. Some data may not be in right encoding issues. Example Student marks data set ,where 12 million
records are there. You may not be able to sum all marks as for few students marks is X ,
   denoting student didn't appear for exam.
   
2. Elections , names of district 1950-1969 a district name changed name in one alphabet
   

######Univariate analysis
1. One variable analysis. Example student system you want to see which education board in india
scores highest. May be karnataka board.
   
For a particular subject what as minimum score attained . Example for maths it was 5, ideally 
minimum could be 0 but it was not given to any student

######Bivariate analysis
2 variable data analysis


######Derived metrics
Some data is not there, but you derive it to gain more information
Example 
1. for JEE Exam to find %age of students who made above cutoff was not available
A new column can be created where for each student we can mark 1, if score was above cutoff
else 0
We can add values for this column for each state and get the percentage


2. After purchase of vehicle, looking at feedback form that People say Registration number of vehicle
is not yet received
   we can create new column by search in text, if registration not received was keyword, mark yes.
